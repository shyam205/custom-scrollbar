               <p>(CNN) — It's set to be one of the first cruises to take to the waters after things start back up this summer.
Departing June 5, the sumptuous MSC Orchestra will take a week-long trip around the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, taking in Italy, Croatia and Greece.
And its journey will begin and end with one of the world's most classic cruise experiences: gliding past the iconic center of Venice, Italy, as it passes St Mark's Square and continues up the Giudecca Canal.

The site of the enormous ships looming over the floating city is set to be a thing of the past, if the government continues with its plans.

Which means that ships taking off this summer look set to dock in the city as they always have.</p>
